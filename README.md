# MTE Project Summary

Determining if and how much the size-temperature relationship (which is inversely proportional) will mitigate effects 
of climate change on ectothermic metabolic rates. 


## Questions

1. Metabolic rates increase when temperature increases. If body size is allowed to change, do metabolic rates increase as much?
2. Does body size change enough, with increasing temperatures, to maintain the original metabolic rate?
3. Does the initial temperature affect the increase in metabolic rate as temperatures increase?

## Analyses

1. Q10, which addresses questions 1 and 2. Determine how much metabolic rate changes when either body size is constant or body size changes. 
2. Comparison of theoretical and empirical mass change, which addresses questions 1 and 2. Determine how much body size would have to decrease to retain original metabolic rate and how much body size actually decreases, and compares these. 
3. Absolute temperature, which addresses question 3. Determine if there is a relationship between initial temperature and results to both analyses 1 and 2. 

## Results

* Question 1: Metabolic rate does not increase due to temperature increases when body size is allowed to change (analysis 1) and body size does decrease when temperature increases (analysis 2). 
* Question 2: When temperature increase, metabolic rate does increase from initial metabolic rate (analysis 1) because body size does not decrease enough for metabolic rate to remain the same (analysis 2). 
* Question 3: When the initial temperature is higher, when temperature increase, metabolic rate does not increase as much from the initial metabolic rate (analysis 3). 

## Interpretation

Metabolic rates of ectotherms will generally increase due to increasing temperatures, such as in climate change scenarios. Metabolic rates will not increase as much when body size can change because of the size-temperature relationship, in which temperature increases cause body size decreases which result in decreasing metabolic rates. Metabolic rates will also not increase as much when the initial temperature is higher, so the metabolic rates of ectotherms closer to the equator may not increase as much relative to those of ecotherms farther from the equator.
